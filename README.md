Glaucoma classification project proposes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based automated system to classify glaucoma stages from eye fundus images. The system preprocesses retinal images, extracts significant features automatically, and classifies them into Normal, Early, Moderate, and Advanced stages.
